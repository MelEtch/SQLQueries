# SQLQueries

The SQL examples contained in this folder are my assignments from a foundational course in SQL with Career Foundry. The project objectives are to perform data analysis for a fictional video rental company called "Rockbuster Stealth LLC." The r first task is to load all of Rockbuster’s data into a relational database
management system (RDBMS). Then, you’ll use SQL to analyze the data and answer any
ad-hoc business questions that other departments may have.

Final Deliverables
The files contained here include
- The Data Dictionary for Rockbuster data including an Entity Relationship Diagram and definitions for each table and variable.
- SQL Queries to give to a data tech team to repeat the work performed.
- A link to the final Tableau dashboard, which can be viewed here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/melanie.etchison/viz/RockbusterBusinessExecutivesPresentation/Story1?publish=yes
